## [v2.0.0-beta.1]
> Oct 7, 2016

- **Feature:** No need to manually instantiate SimpleBar with `new` or to call `recalculate()` anymore. Thanks to mutation observers, this is handled "automatically". Just add `data-simplebar` to any scrollable element you want and it will be SimpleBar-ified.
- **Feature:** No need to know what scroll direction you want, horizontal and vertical scrolls are now supported simultaneously.
- **Feature:** Dependency free. Fully rewritten with ES6 (transpiled to ES6 using Babel).
